\section{Planning}\label{sec:planning}

A planning problem consist of taking $\Sigma$, $\Omega$, $\Psi$, $\Gamma$ (without $\Gamma_f$), $\Gamma_f$, and $E$ as input,
and producing as output zero or more $\Delta$ (our plan) such as $\Phi$ is consistent and $\Phi\models\Gamma_f$.

To do it:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Write every element of $\Gamma_f$ as a constraints.
  \begin{equation}
    \tag{$\Gamma '$}
    \forall \gamma \in \Gamma_f, \neg \gamma \Rightarrow \bot
  \end{equation}
  \item Don't use circumscription on "$happens$". (After all we want to deduce them!)
  \item Find model(s) of $\Phi '$
  \begin{equation}
    \tag{$\Phi '$}
    CIRC[\Sigma;initiates,terminates] \land \Delta \land \Omega \land \Psi \land \Gamma \land \Gamma ' \land E
  \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
