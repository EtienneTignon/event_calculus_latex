\section{Into ASP}\label{sec:asp}

My intuition (based on \cite{circ}) :
\begin{itemize}
  \item We transform the formulas into asp formulas.
  \item We add predicates for the sorts (since we can, now that we are free from first order)
  \item We free the predicates not initially into a CIRC. (and not the ones who represent the sorts)
  \item We see how it goes.
\end{itemize}
